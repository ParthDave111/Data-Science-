The objective of this project is to forecast the price of diamonds by considering their diverse characteristics, including Color, Clarity, Cut, Table, Depths, and Dimensions. Throughout the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase, certain distinctive attributes were observed in the datasets that remained unexplained. However, despite these anomalies, both Machine Learning models exhibited exceptional performance, achieving an accuracy rate of 96%.
